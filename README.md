# Reasoning-With-DeepSeek-R1
Reasoning with DeepSeek R1 

Objective:
This project is a Generative AI-based Reasoning Tool that allows users to submit reasoning problem statements through a web interface and receive logical responses generated by DeepSeek R1 locally installed via Ollama.

Technologies Used
  Backend: Python, FastAPI
  Model Serving: Ollama with DeepSeek R1
  Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

How It Works
  User enters a reasoning problem statement.
  The input is sent to the backend API.
  The DeepSeek R1 model (running locally with Ollama) generates a response.
  The response is formatted into paragraphs (max 40 words per paragraph) and displayed in the UI.
